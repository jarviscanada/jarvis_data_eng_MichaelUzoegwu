    description: Developed an online resume builder using React and Google Firebase to facilitate the creation of my resumes as PDFs. The idea was born out of a need to ensure visual consistency of my customized resume template across content-differing versions. Firebase was used to implement user authentication and resume storage, allowing users to manage multiple versions of their resumes. I used this application exclusively for over two years to create resumes, which contributed to securing multiple internships.

    #git_url: "https://github.com/micuzo/web-app"
    description: Worked as part of a team of three on a 2D platformer-shooter game built with OpenGL and C++, where my main responsibilities were centered around interactions between game entities and the environment. I developed terrain rendering from level data stored in CSV files and implemented an efficient method for detecting collisions between game entities and terrain. Additionally, I applied Dijkstra?s pathfinding algorithm to determine optimal movement for enemy AI agents.
  - name: "MulBot"
    git_url: "https://github.com/micuzo/web-app"
    description: Created an X (formerly Twitter) bot with Python to tweet team lineups of the Manchester United soccer team in a more user-friendly format. The bot retrieves game start times and team lineups, ordered by player positions (instead of shirt numbers), through the API-Football. The start times are used to dynamically set a cron job that triggers the bot to tweet. The application was deployed on a remote Linux machine via DigitalOcean.
